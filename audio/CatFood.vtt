00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:25.300
I did myself up special again today

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:28.040
So please don't get me wet

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.500
As I look up, don't drip on my face

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:33.500
This suddenly rainy evening

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.300
I'm cold;  I hate water

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.100
I want you to dry me off

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.540
Why are you never here

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.120
When I need you?

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.860
I need love

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:49.800
Close to you;  on your lap

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:55.160
I, my, me, mine; I'm all in

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:58.040
Heading for "you", my patch of sunlight

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:01.200
That's right,  I'm a fickle lady

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.260
Yet you're nowhere to be found

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.100
Tears? No, this is just rain

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:12.200
Monochrome loneliness under a cold sky

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.700
Find me, spread your umbrella and tell me you're sorry

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.680
The forecast calls for sunshine

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.500
And shelter from the rain;

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.300
Under a roof of blooming flowers

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.820
Dreaming away, la la la la la la la

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.500
Do me a favor and lend me

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.260
That cat's flappy ears

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:47.700
So I can't hear your fussing

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.760
Don't drone on scolding me darling

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:53.460
I hate how you look when you're mad

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:56.200
I hate how you look when you smile, too

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.900
You're not really my type in the first place

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:01.500
But love me anyway

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:07.200
You need compassion;  that's an important feeling

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.600
You live for me;  your heart's all in

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:15.300
Does honesty always mean selfishness?

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.340
Hey,  I'm your beloved lady

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.600
So forgive me;  I'm not at fault

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:26.340
I'm the one who won't flatter you

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.400
Kindness conflicts with my identity

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400
I can't bring myself to say it

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.900
So don't expect an "I'm sorry"

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.700
If you've still got "it" in your heart

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.460
I shouldn't need to spell it out for you

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:46.000
With words like "Love" and "Passion"

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.800
If you have delicious food

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:02.500
Then I'll stay with you

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.400
If there's a funny show on TV,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.000
Then I'll watch it with you

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.700
If your bed is warm,

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:13.500
Then I'll sleep beside you

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.100
What more do you want?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:18.600
I'll hear you out

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:32.700
I'm a lady who longs for you to accept

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:35.500
That I just want to be spoiled sometimes

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:40.900
Yet you don't understand me

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.500
Passions always cool off

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:46.600
Maybe this is a teary goodbye

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:48.300
Opening the door,

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:52.200
It's "More rain today"

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.900
If it never stops,

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:58.900
I want to be under the same roof

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.600
Forever,  la la la la la la la

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:09.300
I say meow-o by your side

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.740
I say meow-o in your arms

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:20.800
I say meow-o but

00:04:20,800 --> 4:26:00,000
Why can't I say your name?
